# GuessTheNumber
A game for guessing the number

I still don't know what the original text file does so I just make a main.py file and upload that. Hopefully I'm not doing anything too stupid.

This was for an exercise to make a number guessing game. It was fairly straightforward, although my methodology could have been better. When I watched the tutor give her version of it, she defined a load of functions beforehand which she later called in the main function to execute the game. This was a lot more elegant than my haphazard single liners and random declarations. So I am going to strive to make my code more elegant in future. I have also read up on some rules regarding formatting [2 for class, 1 for method or function... can't remember the other] in order to make my code more readable.
